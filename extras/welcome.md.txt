Welcome to the GReY Discord Server
-----
We are an adult gaming community focused on bullshit-free gaming experiences on all platforms and genres. We welcome all types/activity levels of gamers, but are adult gamers with a few evenings a week on average. We enjoy gaming on Xbox One, PS4, PC, and more! Please join us on our subreddit if you haven't (<https://reddit.com/r/grey_online>), as well as check out our landing page for links to social media and all that garbage (<https://greyonline.net/>).

This community was founded by close friends, and kept growing as we added more and more like-minded gamers focused on having a close-knit group to game with.

The rules here aren't too complex:
-----
1. Don't be a douchebag. There is no need to be disrespectful or annoying. We are here to game and have fun, not mess with each other.
2. No spamming of pictures or text.
3. No NSFW content in <#223806376596602880>, please use <#230476235397005312> for shit like that. Also, please don't overuse it. We all have access to reddit, thanks!
4. Deep discussion of controversial topics should be moved to <#334431149528973314>. This pretty much encompasses the normal stuff you wouldn't talk about with someone you just met in person: religion, politics, and other hot-button topics. We're just trying to keep everyone here to hang out and game together. There are definitely SubReddits that specialize in this type of discussion that you can go to and probably have a better debate.

Conversation
-----
While most of our conversations happens in the main <#223806376596602880> channel, we also have a number of genre-specific channels that you can join! Realistically, we aren't trying to split hairs as far as where you should discuss what. This is just a way for you to break off your convo into a relevant channel and to post content where it will be more easily viewed. <#223806376596602880> is typically where you would go to say hi and have _general_ discussions, where as if you're showing off builds or game-specific memes the other channels might be better for that.

=====

Play Together!
-----
We also host a variety of game servers (usually geared towards survival-style games), that you as a member get access to! Just type `!server list` to see the full list of games you can join us on, then you can type `!server <game>` to see details for that game! This list conveniently includes the names of Clans/Guilds we have started on the corresponding games, so we can all band together.
